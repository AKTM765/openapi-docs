# Kiota API client quick starts

Kiota quick starts are step-by-step exercises that guide you through generating an API client for a basic OpenAPI and creating a basic application that uses the generated client. These quick starts use the [JSONPlaceholder REST API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

> [!NOTE]
> Completed code for these quickstarts is available in the [kiota-samples](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota-samples) GitHub repository.
